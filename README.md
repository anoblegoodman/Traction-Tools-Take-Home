Thank you very much for the opportunity to showcase a little of my coding style!

To Run the App:
```
`git clone` this repo
`cd /travel-log`
`npm install`
`npm start`
```

The app should now be running at `localhost:3000`

To Run Cypress Tests:
```
While the app is running `npx cypress open`
Run tests in `travelLog.spec.js`
```
